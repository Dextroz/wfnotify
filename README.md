# wfnotify | wf10toast
![wfnotify](example.gif) ![wf10toast](example.png)

A PyQt5 app | Windows Notifications project | For viewing Warframe API data. 

## wfnotify | Disclaimer
* This build of the app is currently under development and is not final.
* I did not create PyQt5. See [Acknowledgments](#acknowledgments)
* Source code for the entire program can be found in [wfnotify.py](wfnotify.py)

## Current Features
  1. Fetch current Cetustime (Check if night or day).
  2. Fetch current alerts data.
  3. Fetch current fissure data.
  4. Fetch current sortie data.

## Dependencies
wfnotify is written in Python 3.

wfnotify requires the following dependencies:
  1. * [PyQt5](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5) - A Python application framework.
  2. * [Requests](https://github.com/requests/requests/) - Python HTTP Requests for Humans ‚ú®üç∞‚ú®

## Usage
Clone or download the master branch.

Extract and navigate to the project directory and run wfnotify by executing the main entry point file [wfnotify](wfnotify.py):
  ```
  python3 wfnotify.py
  ```

If you don't have python installed then you can run the .exe file which is a packaged version of the application
meaning you can still use the app without a python interpreter installed on you're system.

The .exe is located in:
  ```
  ./dist/wfnotify.exe
  ```
